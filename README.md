# PopularMovies_Project1_Udacity_Android
This is Project 1 of the Google/Udacity Android Nanodegree. Upon launch, the app presents the user with a grid arrangement of movie posters allowing the user to change sort order via a setting: The sort order can be by most popular, or by highest-rated. The user can also tap on a movie poster and transition to a details screen with additional movie details.
